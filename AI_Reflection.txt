AI Usage Reflection

1. What I Implemented Myself

The core solution was planned and implemented by me.

Architecture & Infrastructure
- I designed a decoupled architecture where the backend API and frontend are separate. This makes it easier to scale, deploy independently, and swap or extend the UI without changing the API.
- I defined how the frontend communicates with the backend: routes, payloads, token usage, and error handling.
- I created a Docker-based setup so the entire stack (API, database, frontend, Nginx) can be started and tested consistently with docker compose.

Backend & Domain Logic
- I implemented a lightweight PHP 8 API instead of using a full framework, to demonstrate understanding of HTTP handling, routing, controllers, and clean separation of concerns.
- I designed and implemented the database schema for sports, competitions, teams, venues, events, and their relationships.
- I wrote the core business logic:
  - Creating and listing events (and related data lookups).
  - Validating required fields and allowed statuses.
  - Ensuring valid date and time ranges.
  - Joining related entities efficiently instead of per-row queries.
- I structured the project into clear modules (controllers, services, database layer, helpers) to keep it maintainable.

Integration & Frontend Usage
- I wired the frontend to use my API instead of mock data.
- I implemented the flow to load and display events from the backend, including basic loading and error handling states.
- I verified the end-to-end behavior inside the Docker environment.

All essential behavior — architecture, schema, API design, routing, validation and integration — is my own work, and I can explain it in detail.

2. How AI Influenced the Code

I used AI tools (ChatGPT and JetBrains AI inside the IDE) as assistants for small, well-defined tasks. They did not design the project and did not implement the full solution.

AI-assisted areas included:
- Helper / utility snippets:
  - Suggestions for regex-based helpers and small core functions, which I adapted to my structure.
- Configuration support:
  - Example Nginx configuration patterns to route `/api` to PHP-FPM and serve the frontend.
  - Example Docker/Docker Compose setups to organize services.
  - Guidance for Vite config and environment variables when pointing the frontend to the API.
- Frontend logic hints:
  - Suggestions for date/time conversion from API data to calendar-friendly formats.
  - Guidance for the day-view layout logic to render events without overlap.
- Text & docs:
  - Help drafting and polishing README sections and some user-facing messages.

In all these cases, I:
- Treated AI output as suggestions only.
- Edited, refactored, or rewrote code to match my architecture, naming and standards.
- Removed anything I did not fully understand.

3. How I Evaluated AI Suggestions

For every AI-assisted snippet I:
- Checked correctness against my actual routes, schema, and environment.
- Ensured no hidden dependencies or mismatches with my lightweight framework.
- Tested behavior within my Docker setup.

Unclear or over-complicated proposals were discarded.

4. Why I Made These Technical Decisions

- Decoupled API + frontend:
  To mirror real-world architectures, make scaling easier, and highlight backend/API skills explicitly.
- Lightweight PHP API:
  To show understanding of core web concepts (routing, HTTP, validation, SQL) without relying on generated boilerplate.
- Relational database design:
  The domain (sports, events, teams, venues, competitions) fits a normalized relational model with clear foreign keys.
- Dockerized setup:
  To let reviewers run and inspect everything reliably with minimal setup.

5. If I Had More Time

If I had more time, I would:

- Make the frontend fully responsive for mobile and tablet layouts.
- Implement full event management from the UI:
  - Create, update, and delete events directly from the frontend.
- Add pagination and better list handling for large event sets.
- Introduce a caching layer for frequent reads to reduce database load.
- Add authentication and login-related features:
  - Basic login flow.
  - Frontend session/token validation.
  - Protecting API endpoints accordingly.

6. Honor Statement

I confirm that:
- The core design and implementation are my own work and reflect my understanding.
- AI tools (ChatGPT, JetBrains AI) were used only for guidance, examples, and wording support.
- All AI-influenced code was reviewed, adapted, and verified by me.
- I can explain and modify any part of this project if asked.
